# MSc-Dissertation-Project---Covid-19-Propagation-Model
Modelling the spread of Covid-19 through novel machine learning techniques.
This repository includes a final PDF paper and four Python Jupyter files (.ipynb) which make up the machine learning portion of my 2020 MSc Dissertation project.
The Jupyter files include a data preparation script and three machine learning algorithms including a Random Forest, Support Vector Regression and an Artificial Neural Network.
Employers may use this as a gauge of Python related data analysis abilities although abilities extend far past this given I have developed my skills since completing the project.
The full project code including that completed using the R language can be found in print form in the annex on page 29 of the final PDF paper.
